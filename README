I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery for the following assignment.

I focused on listening for clicks from the user and going into a simplified D20 (table top roll 20 sided dice) rules for the combat mechanics.
This includes the following:
  Roll to see if you hit the enemy (beat its armor class)
    if you confirm hit, roll damage
  update monsters hp, and check for a win condition.
  roll to see if monster hits player
    if confirm hi, roll damange
   update player hp and check for a lose condition.
   
monsters will continue to swarm the player untill they eventually die, the test here is to see how far your hero can make it into the dungeon.
   there are no winners here, only those who slay more beasts and bring glory to their family.
   
users can select one of 4 heroes for this adventure. some being better than others and more ready to take on the challenge.
   
Reflecting back on my project there are many things I would like to do differently if given the chance
-take out the HP updates from combat log and move them to under the portraits.
-populate and create the heros from pure js, this would allow more heros to be added dynamically down the road.
-change the way monsters are summoned to allow party dynamics and users to select whom to attack.
